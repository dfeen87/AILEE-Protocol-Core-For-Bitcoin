# Security Policy

## Project Status

AILEE-Core is a research and prototype codebase. It is **not** production-ready and should not be relied on for real-world security guarantees.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead:

1. Email the maintainers at `security@ailee.example` with:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Affected files or modules (if known)
   - Any potential impact or mitigation suggestions
2. We will acknowledge receipt within **5 business days**.
3. We will coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline with you.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All code under `src/`
- Build tooling and scripts
- Documentation that could mislead users about security guarantees

## Supported Versions

As a research project, there are no supported production versions at this time.
